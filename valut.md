What Vault is

Vault is a centralized secrets management and encryption service. It issues, stores, and audits access to secrets (API keys, DB creds, TLS certs, OAuth tokens, etc.) and can also generate short-lived, on-demand credentials. Think of it as a Just-In-Time (JIT) secrets factory with policy and audit around it.

Why itâ€™s useful for microservices

No hard-coded secrets: Services fetch secrets at runtime via authenticated requests; nothing sits in code or images.

Dynamic (ephemeral) creds: Vault can mint DB usernames/passwords or cloud tokens per service with short TTLs. When they expire, access dies automatically.

Uniform access & audit: One API, one policy model, one audit trail across many languages and teams.

Kubernetes-native patterns: Auth via ServiceAccount JWT; inject secrets with a sidecar/agent; auto-renew leases in the background.

Zero-trust posture: Apps prove identity (K8s, AppRole, OIDC) and get the minimum secrets they need via policies.

Quick comparison: Vault vs Cloud Secret Managers

Vault: strongest when you need dynamic secrets, PKI, transit crypto, multi-cloud, and fine-grained policy with lease/renew/revoke semantics.

Cloud Secret Managers (AWS/GCP/Azure): simpler ops, great within one cloud, solid rotation for some services; fewer cross-platform dynamic engines than Vault.

Many teams use both: Vault for dynamic/PKI/transit, cloud SM for simple app configs.
