Why Each Task is Needed for GKE + MongoDB Setup in GCP
1. Networking & Security Foundation

VPC, Subnets, and CIDR ranges → defines the private “neighborhood” where your cluster and DB live; prevents IP overlaps with other CVS systems.

Firewall rules → control exactly which traffic can reach MongoDB or GKE pods (e.g., only app pods can talk to DB, not the internet).

Static IP ranges → reserve predictable addresses for load balancers and DB endpoints so downstream apps don’t break if IP changes.

Private service access → ensures GKE nodes and DB connect via internal Google backbone, not public internet.

VPC peering → allows secure, low-latency communication if MongoDB is hosted outside GKE (Atlas or VM).

Network segmentation policies → isolates MongoDB in its own subnet for security and compliance (HIPAA/PHI protection).

2. Identity & Permissions

GCP service accounts → provide apps and nodes their own identity to interact with GCP services (no sharing credentials).

IAM roles → enforces least-privilege access (e.g., GKE admin can’t delete billing accounts).

Workload Identity Federation → allows pods to assume GCP identities securely without hardcoding keys.

RBAC roles in GKE → controls who can deploy, who can view logs, who can access secrets inside the cluster.

MongoDB user roles → separate DB admin vs application accounts; ensures developers can’t accidentally drop databases.

3. GKE Cluster Setup

Cluster name, region, node pools → organizes environments (dev vs prod) and ensures high availability across zones.

Node pool machine types → balance cost vs performance (e.g., memory-optimized nodes for MongoDB pods).

Autoscaling policies → automatically adds/removes nodes to handle traffic spikes without overpaying.

Private cluster → blocks public IP exposure; only private internal access to nodes.

IP alias, Pod CIDR, Service CIDR → prevents IP conflicts and ensures smooth Kubernetes networking.

System add-ons (DNS, logging, monitoring) → required for cluster health and app discovery.

Taints and tolerations → dedicate certain nodes for MongoDB workloads, keeping noisy neighbors away.

4. MongoDB Setup

StatefulSet + PVCs (if on GKE) → MongoDB requires stable storage and predictable pod names; StatefulSets provide both.

StorageClass (SSD) → improves query speed and replication performance.

Replica sets → provide high availability (if one node fails, another takes over).

Authentication (SCRAM-SHA-256) → ensures only authorized apps/users can connect to DB.

TLS certificates → encrypt traffic between GKE apps and MongoDB to meet HIPAA/PHI compliance.

VM or Atlas setups → similar needs: patching, replication, secured connectivity.

5. CI/CD Process

Git repo for IaC → version-controls infrastructure (clusters, DB, firewalls) to avoid manual drift.

Terraform modules → reusable building blocks for GKE, MongoDB, IAM, making infra scalable.

Helm charts/K8s manifests → define MongoDB deployment and app configuration in a repeatable way.

Pipelines (ADO/Cloud Build) → automate deployments → no manual kubectl runs.

Secret Manager integration → keeps MongoDB passwords, certs, and keys out of Git repos.

Approval workflows → enforces governance so prod changes require sign-off.

6. Monitoring & Logging

Cloud Logging/Monitoring → captures GKE and MongoDB health for troubleshooting.

Prometheus + Grafana → deeper DB metrics (connections, replication lag, query latency).

MongoDB exporter → integrates DB health into cluster monitoring dashboards.

Alert policies → warn teams if DB is unreachable, disk is full, or pods crash.

ServiceNow integration → triggers incidents automatically when alerts fire.

Log sinks to BigQuery → stores audit logs for compliance investigations or analytics.

7. Security & Compliance

Shielded VM nodes → protect GKE node OS from rootkits and boot-level attacks.

Binary Authorization → ensures only signed, trusted container images are deployed.

Artifact Registry scans → prevent deploying images with known vulnerabilities.

Network Policies → enforce pod-to-pod communication rules; MongoDB only talks to app pods.

Secrets in Secret Manager → keeps credentials encrypted and centrally managed.

Password/key rotation → prevents long-lived credentials that attackers could exploit.

Penetration testing → validates setup against real-world attack scenarios.

8. Backup & DR

Backup strategy → MongoDB data must survive accidental deletion or ransomware.

RPO/RTO targets → define acceptable data loss and downtime (e.g., 15 min RPO, 1 hr RTO).

Restore playbooks → test that backups can actually be restored (many teams skip this).

Multi-zone/region replication → ensures system stays up even if one zone or region fails.

DR runbooks → step-by-step manual guide for ops during disaster.

9. Testing & Validation

Connectivity tests → confirm GKE apps reach MongoDB over TLS only.

Load tests → check system behavior under peak enrollments or claims data queries.

Failover tests → ensure replica nodes take over automatically without data loss.

Scaling tests → confirm cluster autoscaling actually adds/removes nodes.

Security validation → double-check firewall, IAM, and RBAC policies before go-live.

10. Documentation & Handover

Runbooks → give ops a step-by-step for daily checks, restarts, failover actions.

CIDR, firewall, IAM documentation → ensures networking/security choices are transparent.

Architecture diagrams → help leadership and auditors visualize the design.

KT sessions → enable support teams to manage without constant engineering help.

JIRA hierarchy (epics → stories → tasks) → keeps work visible, traceable, and aligned with CVS delivery standards.

✅ In short:

Every point ties back to security, compliance, stability, cost optimization, or member experience.

This makes your JIRA backlog defensible when reviewed by execs, auditors, or InfoSec.
