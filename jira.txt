Perfect üëç ‚Äî you‚Äôre working on **domain name creation in GCP** for your **ID Card portal**, which will host multiple microservices (frontend + backend).
Let‚Äôs make this very clear so you can **update your JIRA ticket professionally**.

## üßæ **JIRA Task Description (Detailed & Clear)**

### **Title:**

Creation of Domain Name in GCP for ID Card Portal Access

### **Description:**

As part of the ID Card Portal setup, we need to create and configure a **custom domain name** in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to access the application externally, instead of using `localhost` or internal IPs.
This domain will serve as the **entry point** for all deployed microservices ‚Äî frontend (UI) and backend (APIs) ‚Äî hosted in GKE clusters.

### **Purpose:**

To provide a consistent and user-friendly domain name for internal/external users to access the ID Card portal components (e.g., `https://idcard.cvshealth.com`).

### **Scope / Steps to be Implemented:**

1. **Decide the domain naming convention**

   * Example: `idcard.<env>.<org>.com` (e.g., `idcard.dev.cvshealth.com`)
   * Ensure it aligns with enterprise DNS standards and environment (dev/test/prod).

2. **Create or identify domain in GCP**

   * Use **GCP Cloud Domains** or **Cloud DNS** (depending on whether domain is newly purchased or already owned by the organization).
   * If existing org domain exists (e.g., `cvshealth.com`), request a subdomain delegation (`idcard.dev.cvshealth.com`).

3. **Configure DNS Zone**

   * Create a **public DNS zone** in **Cloud DNS** (for public access).
   * Define **A records** or **CNAME records** pointing to the appropriate ingress load balancer IP created by GKE.
   * Example:

     ```
     Record type: A
     Name: idcard.dev.cvshealth.com
     Value: <GKE ingress static IP>
     TTL: 300
     ```

4. **Reserve a static IP**

   * In GCP, go to `VPC Network ‚Üí External IP addresses`
   * Reserve a **static IP** (for frontend ingress).
   * This IP will be mapped to the DNS record.

5. **Ingress configuration**

   * Update the Kubernetes Ingress YAML (for frontend and backend) to use this domain.
   * Example:

     ```yaml
     host: idcard.dev.cvshealth.com
     ```

6. **SSL / HTTPS setup**

   * Configure **Google-managed SSL certificate** or integrate with internal PKI.
   * Attach SSL cert to the ingress.

7. **Validation**

   * Verify DNS propagation using:

     ```bash
     nslookup idcard.dev.cvshealth.com
     ```
   * Test app access via browser or curl.

---

### **Expected Outcome:**

* A working domain (e.g., `https://idcard.dev.cvshealth.com`) that routes traffic to the GKE ingress of the ID Card portal.
* The same domain can later host multiple microservices (frontend, backend, admin, etc.) under subpaths or subdomains (e.g., `/api`, `/ui`, `admin.idcard.dev.cvshealth.com`).

## üìÖ **Status Update for Today (Precise and Professional)**

> **Status:** *In Progress*
>
> **Update:**
> Initiated the setup for creating a custom domain name in GCP for the ID Card portal. Finalized the requirement that the domain will be used as a unified entry point for both backend and frontend services deployed via GKE.
> Currently reviewing existing domain ownership and identifying whether a new subdomain (`idcard.dev.cvshealth.com`) can be created under the organizational DNS or if a new domain registration is required through Cloud Domains.
> Next step is to create the DNS zone in Cloud DNS, reserve a static IP, and map it to the GKE ingress endpoint for verification.

‚úÖ **In short:**

* **Description** ‚Üí detailed purpose, steps, and expected outcome.
* **Status** ‚Üí precise, progress-oriented, and clear next steps.

Would you like me to also write a **future status update** (for tomorrow), assuming you‚Äôll finish DNS zone creation and ingress mapping by then?






Perfect üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs what you can post tomorrow as your **next JIRA status update** once you‚Äôve completed the DNS zone and ingress mapping work.

## üóìÔ∏è **Tomorrow‚Äôs JIRA Status Update**

> **Status:** *In Progress ‚Üí Near Completion*
>
> **Update:**
> Completed the creation of the DNS zone in **Google Cloud DNS** for the ID Card portal. Reserved a **static external IP** and mapped it to the DNS record (`A` record) within the zone.
> Verified DNS propagation successfully using `nslookup` and confirmed that the domain resolves to the expected GKE ingress IP.
>
> Also updated the **Ingress YAML** configuration for both frontend and backend services to use the new domain name (`idcard.dev.cvshealth.com`) as the host entry.
>
> Next step is to request or configure a **Google-managed SSL certificate** for enabling HTTPS access, followed by final testing of end-to-end connectivity to the deployed services.

## üìã **Summary of Completed Work**

* ‚úÖ DNS zone created in Cloud DNS
* ‚úÖ Static IP reserved and linked
* ‚úÖ Domain record (`A` record) added
* ‚úÖ Ingress configuration updated to use domain
* ‚úÖ Domain resolution verified

## üîú **Next Steps**

* Set up SSL certificate (Google-managed or internal PKI)
* Verify secure (HTTPS) access through ingress
* Document domain configuration and share with DevOps team for CD integration

‚úÖ This update sounds professional, structured, and clearly shows progress and ownership.
Would you like me to also provide the **final completion update** wording (for when HTTPS testing and portal verification are done)?
