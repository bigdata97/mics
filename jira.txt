Subject: Request to Add QA Redirect URI to Ping SSO Client ID (Priority)

Hi Team,
Hope you are all doing well and having a wonderful Christmas season.

I have created a ticket requesting the addition of the QA redirect URI to our Ping SSO Client ID. This is required to complete the QA environment setup and unblock authentication flow for our application.

Could someone from the team please take a look and help address this request at the earliest convenience?
This is a priority item, as we are currently blocked on QA testing until the redirect URI is added.

Please let me know if you need any additional details from my side.
Thank you so much for your support!

Warm regards,
<Your Name>
