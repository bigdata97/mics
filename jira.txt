Perfect 👍 — based on your story **“CICD Integration & URL Creation for hosting application”**, and subtasks under it, here are polished and accurate **descriptions** and **status updates** for each subtask:

---

## 🧱 **TLIDCE-239 – Setup the application deployment on domain configuration**

### **Description:**

This task involves configuring the **application deployment** to use the newly created **GCP domain name**.
The goal is to make the deployed microservices (frontend and backend) accessible via the registered domain instead of using internal or cluster-local endpoints.

### **Detailed Steps:**

1. Update **Ingress configuration** in the GKE cluster to reference the created domain (e.g., `mics.dev.cvshealth.com`).
2. Map the GKE **Ingress service** to the **reserved static IP** used in the Cloud DNS zone.
3. Verify routing from domain → Ingress IP → backend and frontend services.
4. Validate that all required ports and services are reachable through the configured domain.
5. Ensure that CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions + ArgoCD) correctly deploy updates to the configured domain environment.

### **Status Update (for today):**

> **Status:** In Progress
>
> **Update:**
> Began configuration for linking the deployed application to the created domain setup in GCP. Verified that the static IP and DNS record are resolving correctly.
> Currently updating GKE ingress rules and service annotations to map the ID Card application’s frontend and backend to the new domain. Initial tests show DNS resolution is successful; ingress routing setup is in progress.

## 🧱 **TLIDCE-260 – Setup Landing page module to configure in Domain link**

### **Description:**

This task covers the **validation and configuration of the ID Card portal landing page** after mapping the domain.
The objective is to ensure that the landing page loads correctly and all modules (authentication, dashboard, card view, and supporting APIs) are functional when accessed via the new domain URL.

### **Detailed Steps:**

1. Deploy the frontend build to the target environment (connected to GKE ingress).
2. Verify that `https://mics.dev.cvshealth.com` correctly loads the landing page.
3. Validate UI module connectivity with backend APIs through the domain endpoint.
4. Ensure that all static assets (JS, CSS, images) load securely over HTTPS.
5. Confirm that navigation and links across modules function correctly through the configured domain.

## 🧾 **TLIDCE-238 – Creation of domain name in GCP (status update)**

> **Status:** Near Completion
>
> **Update:**
> Created the public DNS zone in **Cloud DNS** and mapped it with the reserved static external IP.
> DNS propagation validated successfully using `nslookup`, confirming resolution to the correct GKE ingress IP.
> Currently finalizing SSL certificate configuration for secure access to the domain.
> Once HTTPS validation succeeds, the domain setup will be considered complete and ready for deployment integration.

Would you like me to write your **scrum call update** (spoken summary for team) combining these three subtasks in a short, natural paragraph?
