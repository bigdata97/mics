Perfect 👍 — that’s a **very common and very correct ask from leads**, especially in enterprise setups.

Let me break this down **clearly**, and then I’ll give you **exactly what to do**, **what to commit**, and **what status to report**.

---

# ✅ What your lead means by

> “Separate Terraform **plan** and **apply**”

### In simple terms:

* **Plan** = Safe, non-destructive, reviewable
* **Apply** = Risky, controlled, usually gated

Your responsibility **right now** is **ONLY up to `terraform plan`**.

---

# 🎯 Your scope (very important)

You need to deliver:

✔ Terraform code
✔ Terraform backend (state config)
✔ CI pipeline that runs **terraform init + terraform plan**
❌ **NO terraform apply**
❌ **NO infra creation**

This is **100% acceptable** and often mandatory.

---

# 🧱 Expected Architecture (What your lead wants)

```text
PR / Feature Branch
    ↓
GitHub Actions
    ↓
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
    ↓
Plan output stored / uploaded
```

Then later:

```text
Main branch / Manual approval
    ↓
terraform apply   (separate pipeline)
```

---

# 🛠 What you need to implement (Step-by-step)

## 1️⃣ Terraform repo structure (minimum)

```text
terraform/
├── modules/
│   └── gcs-bucket/
│       ├── main.tf
│       ├── variables.tf
│       └── outputs.tf
├── envs/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── backend.tf
│   │   └── terraform.tfvars
│   └── qa/
│       ├── main.tf
│       ├── backend.tf
│       └── terraform.tfvars
└── versions.tf
```

---

## 2️⃣ Backend config (important even for plan)

Example `backend.tf`:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "gcs" {
    bucket  = "tf-state-dev"
    prefix  = "gcs-buckets"
  }
}
```

Even if apply is not run, **backend must be configured**.

---

## 3️⃣ GitHub Actions – PLAN ONLY pipeline

### `.github/workflows/terraform-plan.yml`

```yaml
name: Terraform Plan

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  terraform-plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3
        with:
          terraform_version: 1.6.6

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init
        working-directory: terraform/envs/dev

      - name: Terraform Validate
        run: terraform validate
        working-directory: terraform/envs/dev

      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: terraform plan -out=tfplan
        working-directory: terraform/envs/dev
```

✔ No apply
✔ No approvals
✔ Safe
✔ Reviewable

---

## 4️⃣ (Optional but good) Upload plan output

```yaml
      - name: Upload plan
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: terraform-plan
          path: terraform/envs/dev/tfplan
```

This makes your work **enterprise-grade**.

---

# ❌ What you should NOT do

🚫 Do not add:

```bash
terraform apply
```

🚫 Do not require approvals
🚫 Do not touch prod

---

# 🧪 How to validate your work

Run locally:

```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
```

CI should show:

* ✅ Init success
* ✅ Plan generated
* ❌ No resources created

---

# 📌 What to say in JIRA (very important)

### 🔹 Status Update (20–30% complete)

You can **safely post this** 👇

> **Status Update:**
> Terraform module structure and backend configuration are in progress.
> CI pipeline has been set up to run `terraform init`, `validate`, and `plan` (plan-only, no apply).
> Plan execution is being validated for DEV environment.
> Apply phase will be implemented as a separate workflow once approved.

This sounds **honest, professional, and aligned**.

---

# 🗣 What to say in Scrum (1–2 lines)

> “I’ve started with Terraform structure and CI setup.
> Terraform plan pipeline is in progress — apply will be a separate gated workflow.”

This is **exactly what leads expect to hear**.

---

# 📈 How much is this complete?

| Task                    | %        |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Terraform code scaffold | 10%      |
| Backend config          | 5%       |
| Plan pipeline           | 15%      |
| Validation              | 5%       |
| **Total**               | **~35%** |

So **20–30% claim is very safe**.

---

# ✅ Final reassurance

You are:

* Following best practices
* Doing exactly what enterprise leads want
* Not overstepping scope
* Building future-ready pipelines

If you want next, I can:

* Draft the **separate apply pipeline**
* Add **manual approval gates**
* Review your Terraform module
* Help you reply back to your lead confidently

Just tell me 👍
