ID Card System — Java Microservices & CI/CD (Jira-ready Task List)

Below is a Jira-ready breakdown you can paste into tickets. It’s organized as Epics → Stories/Tasks.
Each story includes: Why (reason) and Acceptance (short DoD).

EPIC-1: Microservice Foundations (Spring Boot + GKE)

MS-1 — Create service template (Spring Boot + Gradle/Maven)

Why: Standardizes structure, speeds new service spin-up.

Acceptance: Template repo with src/*, test setup, profiles (dev, qa, prod), README, sample controller.

MS-2 — API contract & DTOs for “Member Profile” service

Why: Aligns domain model; prevents contract drift.

Acceptance: OpenAPI 3 spec checked in; DTOs generated/handwritten; lint passes.

MS-3 — Health & readiness endpoints

Why: GKE & Apigee require /healthz and /readyz for rollout safety.

Acceptance: Endpoints return 200; liveness/readiness probes configured in Helm.

MS-4 — Central exception handling & error codes

Why: Consistent errors across services; easier vendor debugging.

Acceptance: Global @ControllerAdvice, error schema documented, tests cover common failures.

MS-5 — Config strategy (Spring Config/Env + Secret Manager/Vault)

Why: No secrets in code; env-specific toggles.

Acceptance: Externalized config; secrets pulled at runtime; local dev uses .env/mock.

MS-6 — HTTP clients with resiliency (Resilience4j)

Why: Timeouts/retries/circuit breakers avoid cascading failures.

Acceptance: Policies defined; chaos tests simulate downstream failure.

MS-7 — Kafka producers/consumers (or Pub/Sub)

Why: Event-driven flow for ID generation & print pipeline.

Acceptance: Topics/consumer groups configured; idempotent consumer; dead-letter strategy set.

MS-8 — Outbox/Idempotency for write-side

Why: Avoids duplicate prints or duplicate member updates.

Acceptance: Outbox table/collection or token strategy; replay tests pass.

MS-9 — MongoDB repository & schema governance

Why: Stable document shapes; predictable performance.

Acceptance: Collections, indexes, TTLs defined; slow-query threshold alerts.

MS-10 — Audit & access logs with correlation IDs

Why: Regulated domain; trace who did what across services.

Acceptance: X-Correlation-Id propagated; audit events persisted; log examples in Splunk.

MS-11 — OpenTelemetry tracing + metrics

Why: End-to-end tracing across APIs → Kafka → Mongo.

Why: Protect APIs; consistent auth (OIDC/JWT).

Acceptance: Token validation; role checks; security tests for common attacks.

MS-13 — Request/response validation (Bean Validation)

Why: Fail fast; clean data into the system.

Acceptance: Constraints annotated; 400s on invalid input; unit tests included.

MS-14 — Domain logging taxonomy (PII/PHI redaction)

Why: HIPAA-minded logging; safe debugging.

Acceptance: Redaction filters; no sensitive fields in logs; sample events reviewed.

MS-15 — Containerization (Dockerfile + Jib/Buildpacks)
